# LeetCode NeetCode Roadmap Solutions

Welcome to my repository, which is dedicated to solving problems from the LeetCode platform structured around the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Here, you will find my approaches to the challenges, aiming to help not only myself but also others who are preparing for software engineering interviews or just looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

## Introduction

This repository houses solutions to problems curated by NeetCode, focusing on core topics that are vital for understanding and mastering algorithmic challenges. The solutions provided are an amalgamation of different programming languages, thorough explanations, and complexity analyses.

## Repository Structure

The repository mirrors the NeetCode roadmap and covers the following topics, each in its dedicated directory:

# Arrays & Hashing

The "Arrays & Hashing" category covers problems that deal with array manipulation and hash table data structures, focusing on common techniques like mapping and sets.

- Solution files named after the problem, with a consistent naming convention like `problem_title.extension` (e.g., `two_sum.py`).

## Progress Tracker

Progress through the NeetCode roadmap will be tracked here:

- Arrays & Hashing: X/XX completed
- Two Pointers: X/XX completed
- ... (continue for each topic)

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to a Topic**: Choose a topic you want to focus on and explore the associated problems.
2. **Study the Solutions**: For each problem, read the `README.md` file to understand the solution approach and learn about the thought process involved.
